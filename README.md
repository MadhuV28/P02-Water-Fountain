P02
This assignment involves developing a graphical implementation of a particle system. Particle
systems have long been used in computer graphics to render amorphous objects like: fire,
clouds, and water. The idea behind this technique is to use several small images or shapes
that together give the appearance of a large amorphous object that does not necessarily have a
clearly defined surface.1 The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of this assignment will be written
using the java processing graphic library.
The goals of this assignment include:
• Practice how to create and use objects,
• Develop the basis for creating an interactive graphical application, and developing your
own test methods.
• Give you experience working with callback methods to define how your program responds
to mouse or key based input.
The source code is in the '' directory.
